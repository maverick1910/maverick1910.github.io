            <p>In the faster paced world where everywhere you go all you see are people who are doing amazing things in their life, working for that top MNC , attending that Ivy League school, becoming a social media influencer or even starting their own venture.</p>
            <p>Infact, social media had made the world a very small place to live in , we had access to know what people were doing with their lives , we are able to learn new things, we are able to learn about every positive and negative thing on Social Media. Every time I went through my LinkedIn posts I would find people doing amazing things and I just could not stop looking at their profiles , they were just perfect !</p>

            <p>It was 2018 , the year where basically the society decides where you will be in your life on the basis of your JEE marks. Well, just like other people I was in the race as well, a race which I had never even imagined that it could turn things upside down. Well , I did not get into any top institutes , rather I got into a college called as VBIT. Relatives, family , friends thought "Iska toh Career gaya, iska IIT mein hua heen nahi" . Listening to them even for sometime I thought maybe they were true .....maybe my career was over. Ughhhhh.......how stupid I was. Infact, everyone has been through that face and it kills us , it makes us feel very pathetic. Looking at my friends getting into top colleges ..it was like hell. Recently in 2020, during the pandemic I faced this again , I reached at certain point and felt that I don't see my future anywhere.</p>
            <p>But....Entrepreneurship taught me things which changed my perspective.People think entrepreneurship is cool , it's like the trending tag on Instagram which people think is cool. People think that someone takes up entrepreneurship for making money. NO, Entrepreneurship is about creating value , a value which is highly inclined to change , it's about solving those wicked problems which we encounter.</p>
            <p>
                Entrepreneurship taught me that one will probably fail , sooner or later , but in the last 3 months I got to know what hard-work truly was. Working for more than 12 hours a day with teams for the hackathon , it was hectic, applying for it was hectic, selection process was very rigid . Fun-fact, I applied for a mentor role for some city level hackathon and was not selected before applying to MLH Hack.</p>
